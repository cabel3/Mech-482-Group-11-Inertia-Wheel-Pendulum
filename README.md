# 1. Introduction
The Inertia Wheel Pendulum is an underactuated 2-DoF system consisting of a pendulum arm connected to an inertal mass, the wheel. The wheel is actuated by a single servor motor, which exerts a torque on the wheel. The system is controlled by using the motor to add or remove angular energy and momentum to the system. 

Control of the Inertia Wheel Pendulum consists of 2 phases: the swing-up, and maintaing an inverted position. Because the mathematical model of the swing-up phase is non-linear, it is considered out of the scope of this project. Instead, the pendulum will begin in the inverted postion, and maintain that position when disturbed by a small force.

# 2. Objectives
* To derive mathmatical model of system via Lagrangian eqns of motion
* To convert that mathmatical model into a State-Space Representation
* To create a Coppelia simulation that models our system
* To create a Simulink program to control the Coppelia model
* To arrive at a functional control scheme that is able to bring the pendulum back to inverted position after small deflection
